# REST_API_using_Flask_and_Python-Udemy

I have created this REST APIs project using Flask and Python. Here one can create a store, items with price in that store, update item's price, delete items, delete store.
This project is also capable to authenticate users. One can register with username and password, then he can logged in and get this store.
